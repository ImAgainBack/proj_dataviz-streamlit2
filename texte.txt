Project Overview 
Design and build a data-storytelling web app using Streamlit. Your app should load a real, public dataset, clean and analyze it, and present an interactive dashboard that guides users through a clear narrative (problem → analysis → insights → implications). The focus is on storytelling: each chart, metric, and interaction should support the narrative and answer specific user questions. 

Approved data portals (choose one dataset or a small, coherent bundle from one source): - French open data:  

https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets 

https://gd4h.ecologie.gouv.fr/en/catalogue 

https://data.europa.eu/data/combined?locale=en 

Tip: Prefer datasets with reasonable size, a clear domain question
Learning Objectives 
By the end of the project, you should be able to: - Frame a data question and turn it into a story arc with audiences and takeaways. - Ingest, clean, and validate open data; document assumptions and caveats. - Build an interactive dashboard in Streamlit with clear UX and performance best practices. - Apply EDA and light analytics (group-bys, joins, aggregations, simple models where relevant). - Communicate insights visually using appropriate charts, maps, and annotations. - Package and ship a reproducible app with a README. 

Deliverables 
Streamlit app (deployable) with a coherent narrative and interactive components.
